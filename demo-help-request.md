# The Demo Help Request

I was working on a project yesterday, left it, and came back to my work today and finished the project. I went to go commit my changes to the repository, I entered ```git commit -m "this is just a test‚Äù```, and instead of the repository updating, I received the following error:
```fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git```
What does this mean? I have previously made a repository for this project.
